The fetal health dataset is available on Kaggle and contains detailed records derived from cardiotocogram (CTG) exams. This data includes various features related to the heart rate and uterine contractions during pregnancy. The aim of the dataset is to classify fetal health into three categories: Normal, Suspect, and Pathological, as assessed by expert obstetricians.
Using this dataset, I performed a classification task employing a decision tree algorithm. Decision trees are intuitive models that split data based on feature values to predict the class label—in this case, the health status of the fetus. By training the decision tree on this dataset, the model learns patterns and rules that help distinguish between the three fetal health classes based on the input features.
This approach leverages the rich information in the CTG data to provide an automated prediction of fetal health status, which can support healthcare providers in early detection and intervention decisions during pregnancy. The decision tree classification offers interpretability of the model’s decisions, which is valuable in a medical context to understand which features contribute most to the classification outcomes. This helps ensure that the predictive model is not only accurate but also transparent for clinical use.
Overall, this project demonstrates how machine learning techniques like decision trees can be effectively applied to real-world healthcare datasets such as fetal health classification to provide meaningful insights and aid in clinical decision making.
